## About

We propose to develop a comprehensive fitness exercise web application that provides users with access to a vast database of exercises, workout routines, and fitness-related information. This application will not only serve as a resource for users looking to improve their fitness but will also include an API that allows other developers to integrate its data into their own fitness apps and platforms.
